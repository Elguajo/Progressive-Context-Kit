# Next Session

> Volatile hot context. Overwrite this file on each meaningful handoff. Durable completed-phase history belongs in `docs/completions/` with only a compact bridge in the completed phase `Completion Record`.

Outcome: <IN PROGRESS | PHASE COMPLETE | PROJECT COMPLETE>

## Current phase
<exact Roadmap phase or NONE — PROJECT COMPLETE>

## Completed this session
- <compact list; do not accumulate prior-session history>

## Verification evidence
- `<check>` → <result>

## Current working state
<RUNNABLE / GREEN | KNOWN BROKEN / RECOVERABLE | BLOCKED>

When the state is `KNOWN BROKEN / RECOVERABLE` or `BLOCKED`, replace the placeholder with the
exact state and add both fields below. Runtime Audit rejects a declared non-runnable state without
them; do not imply success that was not observed.

- Why: <exact observed issue, dependency, or decision>
- First recovery action: <one concrete action>

## Blockers / uncertainty
- <none or exact issue>

## Next action
<one unresolved execution target only>

If the current task, acceptance criterion, manual verification, blocker, or other gate is still unresolved, keep this action focused on closing that gate. Do not name or describe later queued work here.

## NEXT SESSION PROMPT
```text
Continue only: <same single unresolved execution target as "Next action" above>

Finish and persist evidence for this target before selecting any later task or phase work.
Substeps needed to complete this same target are allowed, but do not bundle a second queued
execution target into this handoff. Do not use "then continue/start/implement <later task>"
while this target remains unresolved.

Read the active instruction layers, recover project state from the Default Read Set,
verify the Roadmap marker, and reconcile this handoff against the current Phase, live
repository/worktree state, and decisive evidence before continuing this one target. Do not reread
full completed phases, completion reports, or chat history unless a specific contradiction
requires that historical evidence.
```
